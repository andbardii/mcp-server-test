This repository contains a collection of tests and implementations for various Model-Controller-Provider (MCP) server architectures. Each implementation focuses on different aspects of MCP pattern and database interactions.

## Current Implementations

### 1. MCP PostgreSQL Server (`mcp-psql/`)
A PostgreSQL-specific implementation that:
- Provides safe database access through a structured API
- Enables AI systems to interact with databases
- Implements read-only query validation
- Includes pre-built analysis templates
- Supports schema exploration and data analysis

### 2. MCP Figma Server (`mcp-figma/`)
A Figma-specific implementation that:
- Enables AI systems to interact with Figma designs
- Provides structured access to Figma files and components
- Implements design analysis and manipulation capabilities
- Supports AI-driven design suggestions and modifications
- Includes pre-built design templates and patterns

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A testing ground for different MCP implementations
- A reference for MCP pattern best practices
- A collection of database and design tool interaction patterns
- A showcase of AI integration approaches with various systems

## Getting Started

Each implementation in this collection has its own setup instructions and documentation. Please refer to the specific implementation's README for details.

## Contributing

New MCP implementations and test cases are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:
1. Create a new directory for your implementation
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Follow the existing project structure
4. Add appropriate tests
